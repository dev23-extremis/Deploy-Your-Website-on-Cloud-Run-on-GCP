Deploy Your Website on Cloud Run on Goggle Cloud Platform

You can use Cloud Run's fully managed PaaS solution or your own Google Kubernetes Engine (GKE) clusters to implement "serverless" development in containers.  In this lab, you will run the latter situation.

 The exercises are arranged to mirror the typical experience of a cloud developer:


 From your application, create a Docker container.
 Install the container on Cloud Run.
 Change the webpage
 Release a new version with no downtime.
